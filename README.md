Movie Genre Classification
This project implements a classification model to predict movie genres based on movie descriptions. It uses the datasets available on Kaggle.
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify movies into different genres based on their textual descriptions. This type of natural language processing (NLP) task has applications in content recommendation systems, automated tagging, and content organization.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and includes:

train_data.csv: Contains movie descriptions and their corresponding genres for training the model
test_data.csv: Contains movie descriptions without genre labels for evaluation
description.txt: Information about the dataset and the classification task
test_data_solution.csv: Contains the correct genre labels for the test data (for evaluation purposes)
